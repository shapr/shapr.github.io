Shae Erisson - For the moment I live in Brooklyn, New York and attend the Recurse Center where I decide each day what will be the most fun code to write!

Also, writing a blog is harder than talking to people, it's hard to guess how much the reader will already know.

You can contact me on twitter http://twitter.com/shapr or find me on the freenode IRC network as shapr.
