* tiling window managers, xmonad on ubuntu 19.04

I like screen real estate, my laptop has a 4k screen and I mean to use every last pixel to display code. Gnome on Ubuntu has two bars at the top of the screen, I want to use that space for code!

I often press F11 in various applications to take up the entire screen, but I want more, it's time to install [[https://xmonad.org/][xmonad]]!

xmonad has great features like virtual desktops. I keep my shell open in desktop 1, emacs on 2, a browser on 3, and other apps on their own desktops.
I'm also a fan of recompiling and reloading my xmonad config at runtime to try out new changes.

xmonad expects to be installed system-wide so it can easily recompile itself, but I've since switched to cabal's new-build and new-install commands.

* xmonad with cabal new-install
I asked on the #xmonad IRC channel, geekosaur told me I can use a build script to get around system-wide installation.

I'm still fighting with build scripts but in short I ended up creating a [[https://github.com/shapr/shaexmonad][separate cabal project]] that depends on xmonad and xmonad-contrib.
The [[https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-testing][xmonad-testing]] repository was suggested, it includes an [[https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-testing/blob/master/build-scripts/build-with-cabal-new.sh][example build script]].

1. git clone https://github.com/shapr/shaexmonad.git
4. mkdir ~/.xmonad
5. cp shaexmonad/build ~/.xmonad/build
6. chmod u+x ~/.xmonad/build
7. edit ~/.xmonad/build and change SRC_DIR to the location of your xmonad checkout

create /usr/share/xsessions/xmonad.desktop and paste in

#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=XMonad The Incredible
  Comment=Lightweight tiling window manager
  Exec=/home/shae/.xmonad/xmonad-x86_64-linux
  Type=Application
#+END_SRC

You will want to change the value in the Exec= field to match your install location!

* requirements

** install Haskell
1. git clone https://github.com/haskell/ghcup.git
2. cd ghcup
3. mkdir -p ~/.ghcup/bin # create a directory for ghcup
4. export PATH=~/.ghcup/bin:$PATH # add the new directory to your PATH
5. ./ghcup install 8.6.3 # this will download the Haskell compiler for your platform (Linux, Mac, WSL?)
6. ./ghcup install-cabal # this will install the package manager
7. cabal new-update # if this doesn't work, ~/.ghcup/bin/ probably is not in your PATH

** install utilities

cabal new-install xmobar

If you want to use the exact same config as above, you'll need to install trayer.

If you have gnome installed, you'll have nm-applet.
