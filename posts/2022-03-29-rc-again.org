* Recurse Center AGAIN

[[../images/necropants.png]]

I applied! I got in! I'm back, hurrah!

* The Plan

1. learn Rust
2. build some tools to improve meaningful social interactions on the internet
   No, I don't yet know what this means, but I have several ideas that'll be in my next blog post.

* What's changed?

Recurse Center is virtual the past two(?) years, so I'm not in the physical space.
I like staring at my screens and typing on my cool keyboard, but I miss in person interactions.
Maybe I can find some DC area RCers?
