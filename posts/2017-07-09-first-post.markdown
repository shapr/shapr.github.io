title: Faster Haskell code, by example!
---

Posted on $date$

Once you get past reading books and subject-specific blog posts, how do you bring all the pieces together and apply them to your own code?
This is the first in a series of blog posts of examining existing Haskell code with the goal of having bite sized conclusions I can use in my own code.

This series will start by solving programming puzzles for the [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016).
I will compare [my Haskell solutions](https://github.com/shapr/adventofcode2016) to those written by others, starting with [Day 1](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1).

If you'd like to follow along, write up your own solutions and see how they compare.



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
