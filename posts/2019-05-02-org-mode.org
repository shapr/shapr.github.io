* org-mode

If you use emacs, you should try [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]!

I worked at my last job just under four years, and in that time I accumulated 67,000 lines of notes in my employer related org files. 
Due to my copious note-taking, I became the team historian, always able to provide details on what we did years earlier.

I started using org as a simple todo list. Then I started clocking in to each todo item and that turned into [[https://github.com/volhovm/orgstat][feedback loops]] to figure out why some things took so long.

Below is test input for org-mode posts with hakyll, most of this learned from [[https://turbomack.github.io/posts/2016-12-21-org-mode-in-hakyll.html][turbomack]]'s post.
