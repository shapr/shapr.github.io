<p>I was accepted to the <a href="http://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>! I’ll be attending from May 20 2019 to August 8th 2019, I’m excited!</p>
<p>The Recurse Center encourages blogging to help attendees solidify what they’ve learned (and I suspect to get the good word out about recurse center)</p>
<p>So it’s time to resurrect my blog, check all the features, and put up some content!</p>

<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>Wait, why would I want to attend summer camp for nerds when I have more than twenty years professional experience writing code?</p>
<p>Because there is so much more to learn!</p>
<p>Additionally, my previous job caused me much stress at the end, and I’d like to take a break from external expectations. Recurse Center is also a great social hack where I can spend twelve weeks on self study, and future employers won’t ask me why I have a three month hole in my employment history.</p>
<h1 id="the-plan">The Plan</h1>
<p>My rough goal is to get sufficiently good at writing Haskell that I can get a job writing Haskell after my batch at recurse center.</p>
<p>That means my overall plan is to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>complete the qfpl <a href="https://github.com/data61/fp-course">fp-course</a></li>
<li>attempt to rebuild my ancient project idea <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/FermatsLastMargin">Fermat’s Last Margin</a></li>
<li>make sure to spend time pairing with others on their projects!</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the points from the recurse center manual is “develop a good mental model of your code”. I want to extend that to my learning, so I plan to try different approaches, and at the end of each week, figure out which practices are teaching me the most.</p>
